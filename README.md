# vmstate-operator
This Operator will manage the state of cloud resources from kubernetes environment. Right now this only supports VMs on AWS. In future, other cloud services can be included and for various other cloud platforms like GCP, Azure etc.

## Description
There are two CRs that need to created.
First CR will be the manager pod that will keep on watching the state of the cloud resources and take corrective action if that does not match. 
Second CR will create the cloud resource that is supposed to be managed. Upon deletion of the CR, the resource is suposed to be deleted.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.

**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

Install operator-sdk & golang.

Need to login to any image registry and replace registry in the command below & create a secret in the operator namespace with AWS environment variables

```
git clone <your-repo>
cd <your-repo>
git checkout -b <new branch name>
go mod init github.com/<your-repo>
go mod tidy
operator-sdk init --domain <your-name>.com --repo github.com/<your-repo>
operator-sdk edit --multigroup=true
operator-sdk create api     --group=Azure     --version=v1     --kind=<your-name>AzureAVM
operator-sdk create api     --group=gcp     --version=v1     --kind=<your-name>GCPGCE
operator-sdk create api     --group=aws     --version=v1     --kind=<your-name>AWSEC2
operator-sdk create api     --group=awsmanager     --version=v1     --kind=<your-name>AWSManager
git add *
git commit -m"...."
git push origin < new branch name>
```



### Running on the cluster
1. Build and push your image:
	
```sh
make generate;make manifests;
make docker-build;
sudo docker push quay.io/<your-registry>/vmstate-operator:latest;
```
OR

```
make generate;make manifests;
make docker-build docker-push IMG="quay.io/<your-registry>/vmstate-operator:latest"
```
	
2. Deploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make deploy IMG="quay.io/<your-registry>/vmstate-operator:tag"
```

3. Apply Custom Resources & create secret:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic aws-secret --from-literal=region=us-east-1 --from-literal=aws-secret-access-key=<secret access key> --from-literal=aws-access-key-id=<secret access key id>
kubectl apply -f config/samples/awsmanager_v1_awsmanager.yaml -n vmstate-operator-system;
kubectl apply -f config/samples/aws_v1_awsec2.yaml -n vmstate-operator-system;
```
3. Check jobs & AWSEC2/AWSManager resources:

```
kubectl get jobs -n vmstate-operator-system;
kubectl get awsec2 -n vmstate-operator-system;
kubectl get awsmanager -n vmstate-operator-system;
```

4. Delete CR:

```
kubectl delete awsec2 <cr-name> -n vmstate-operator-system;
kubectl delete awsmanager <cr-name> -n vmstate-operator-system;
```

5. Undeploy controller:

```
make undeploy
```
## TODO: Few features that can be enhanced in minimal time

```
1.Set restart policy for Manager CR & image pull policy for EC2 CR
2.Modify to take customized tag as input form CR. Modify types.go/sample CR file [will be aplicable to both the CRDs]
3.Modify to take AMI & Instance type as configmap from file. Focus only on t2 series for testing
4.Minimize the image footprint by using ubi-minimal for Manager & EC2 CR
5.Fill in the delete instance stub
6.Set the status of the EC2 CR [For example: in-progress, created, terminated]
7.Apply change for instanceType, watch configmap for any changes- only for EC2 CR

```

This project can be extended for various other cloud services for different cloud providers
